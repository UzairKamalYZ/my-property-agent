"""
orchestrator/agent_interface.py — client-facing facade over the multi-agent graph.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
All clients (REST API, Telegram bot, cron job) were originally written against
LocalAgent, which exposes:

    agent.ask(prompt, stream=False, session_id="default") -> str | Generator

OrchestratorAgent provides the exact same interface so every client can switch
to the multi-agent pipeline by changing one import line — nothing else changes.

STREAMING NOTE
--------------
_stream_tokens() delegates to MultiAgentGraph.stream_tokens(), which uses
LangGraph's stream_mode="messages" to intercept AIMessageChunk objects from
the synthesiser node as the LLM produces them.  Agent-node tokens are filtered
out so only the final synthesis reaches the caller.

    Thin facade over MultiAgentGraph.

    Matches the LocalAgent interface used by all clients:
        agent.ask(prompt)                      → str
        agent.ask(prompt, stream=True)         → Generator[str, None, None]
        agent.ask(prompt, session_id="abc")    → str
        agent.close()                          → None  (context-manager safe)

    Construction
    ------------
    Instantiating OrchestratorAgent triggers MultiAgentGraph.__init__, which:
      - loads agents from agents.json
      - instantiates each enabled agent (LLM + vector store connections)
      - compiles the LangGraph StateGraph
    This happens once at startup and is reused for every subsequent ask().

        Parameters
        ----------
        prompt     : the user's raw question
